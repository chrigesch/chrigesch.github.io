### Skills-based projects
I have developed [DataChum](https://datachum.streamlit.app/), a web application that streamlines data analysis, facilitates result interpretation, and effectively communicates findings through visually engaging graphics. This tool empowers users to easily navigate complex datasets and gain valuable insights, promoting efficient decision-making and enhancing data-driven communication. Datachum encompasses four modules: Exploratory Data Analysis, Classification and Regression, Cluster Analysis, and Deployment.
