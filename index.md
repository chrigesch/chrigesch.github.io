### Final Project of the Relational Database Certification

For this project of the [300 hours - FreeCodeCamp - Relation Database Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fccc9d03d80-7181-4b05-98ad-2407f0379bd3/relational-database-v8), I used Bash scripting, PostgreSQL, and Git to create a number guessing game that runs in the terminal and saves user information.

### Peer-reviewed research article using Cluster Analysis

An empirical approach called Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) offers an alternative for studying co-occurring syndromes. This study aimed to determine the patterns of psychological symptoms using LPA, considering the limited existing research utilizing this method across a wide range of symptoms. Additionally, the study aimed to analyze differences among the identified latent subgroups in terms of symptom severity, coping strategies, selected social support variables, personality traits, and sociodemographic variables.

### Peer-reviewed research article using Supervised Machine Learning in a regression task

This study explored the association between social support, emotion regulation, coping, and psychological symptoms. Using supervised machine learning models, 4000 models were evaluated and the findings indicated that adaptive strategies have considerable effects on maladaptive strategies, but they do not have significant effects on symptoms. Contrariwise, social support variables have significant effects on symptoms, while they do not have major effects on maladaptive strategies. The study highlights the importance of regulatory flexibility in maintaining adequate levels of social support for well-being.

### Skills-based projects
I have developed [DataChum](https://datachum.streamlit.app/), a web application that streamlines data analysis, facilitates result interpretation, and effectively communicates findings through visually engaging graphics. This tool empowers users to easily navigate complex datasets and gain valuable insights, promoting efficient decision-making and enhancing data-driven communication. [DataChum](https://datachum.streamlit.app/) encompasses four modules: Exploratory Data Analysis, Classification and Regression, Cluster Analysis, and Deployment.
